# Hybrid-Hashing-with-Variable-Length-Mixing-HHVLM-
HHVLM is a cryptographic hashing algorithm designed to offer a balanced approach to security and performance. The algorithm combines non-linear bitwise operations, dynamic memory allocation, and multi-round compression to produce a 256-bit hash from arbitrary input data.
